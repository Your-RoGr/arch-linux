## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to a custom, independently developed x86-64 distribution of GNU/Linux - [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux). This spin uses [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) as its window manager, a tiling Wayland compositor based on wlroots.

## Installation

To install, you need to prepare a bootable USB with an Arch Linux image, for example, you can download the image and write it to a USB using Rufus for Windows:

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)

1. After preparation, configure your BIOS, enabling UEFI and selecting the USB with the Arch Linux image as the primary boot device. Save and restart.

2. After restarting, the Arch Linux installation window should appear. Select the "Arch Linux install medium (x86_64, x64 UEFI)" option.

3. After the image is prepared for installation, you will see the "root@archiso" prompt. Install git and clone this repository:

```sh
pacman -Sy --nocofirm git
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Your-RoGr/arch-linux.git
```

4. Then, navigate to the git folder, give execution permissions, and run the installer (the installation process takes several minutes, depending on your internet speed and ROM speed):

```sh
cd arch-linux
```

```sh
chmod +x arch-installer.sh
```

```sh
./arch-installer.sh
```

5. Next, you need to enter your username, computer name, select a disk from the proposed options, select a [Time Zone](https://www.howtosop.com/linux-all-available-time-zones/), and agree to all questions (make sure you select the correct disk for the system). You can also format the disks as needed and then run the installation, for which you need to write "skip" instead of the disk. By default, two partitions are created:

- fat32 1MiB 513MiB (/boot)
- ext4 513MiB 100% (/)

6. Then, you need to set the root and user passwords

7. At the end of the installation, restart your computer after seeing the message (if your computer doesn't shut down automatically) and select the disk with /boot as the primary boot device in your BIOS:

```sh
[ OK ] Reached target System Power Off
```

8. Then, log in as your user and clone this repository again:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Your-RoGr/arch-linux.git
```

9. Next, navigate to the git folder, give execution permissions, and run the post-installation script (the installation process takes a significant amount of time, depending on your internet speed and ROM speed):

```sh
cd arch-linux
```

```sh
chmod +x arch-post-installation.sh
```

```sh
./arch-post-installation.sh
```

10. At the beginning of the installation, you need to select a video driver (1 - nvidia (for GTX 750 and newer), 2 - amd), or skip if your video card doesn't meet the requirements (install drivers manually).

11. Wait for the installation to complete and enjoy using Arch Linux with Hyprland!

> You may need to restart

### Additional

1. You can install CUDA (if you have a GTX 1050 or newer video card) and/or a Python virtual environment with Jupyter Lab and Python packages from requirements.txt:

```sh
./python-installer.sh
```

> To work with the environment, use the following command:

```sh
source ~/jupyterlab/bin/activate.fish
```

2. You can set up a PostgreSQL user:

```sh
sudo su - postgres
```

```sh
psql -c "alter user postgres with password 'postgres'"
```

```sh
exit
```

3. You can install pgadmin4, which requires additional settings:

```sh
chmod +x pgadmin.sh
```

```sh
./pgadmin.sh
```

## Configuration

1. Configuring multiple monitors. [Link to documentation](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/). By default, it is configured automatically. The line in ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf (after installation):

```conf
monitor=,preferred,auto,1
```

2. Wallpapers need to be copied to the ~/.config/wallpapers directory. The following formats are supported: jpeg, png, gif, pnm, tga, tiff, webp, bmp, farbfeld

3. Waybar, swaylock, swww, rofi, hypridle (hypr), and alacritty have their own configuration files for external appearance and functionality, which are located in their respective directories.

> You can familiarize yourself with other Hyprland settings in the [documentation](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) and perform them in the ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf file.
